### Prop.
Suppose $f$ is complex diff., with $f^\prime(z)$ continuous, and $\gamma$ is piecewise diff. on connecting $z_0$ and $z$. Then $\int_\gamma f^\prime(\omega)d\omega = f(z)-f(z_0)$.

#### Corollary
I. From the prop. above, if $f^\prime(z)=0$, then $f(z)$ is constant.

II. Does there exist $F:\Omega\to\mathbb C$ s.t. $F^\prime(z) = f(z)$? If such $F$ exist then $F(z) = \int_\gamma f(\omega)d\omega$.

### Theorem [Goursat]
$f: \Omega\to\mathbb C$ is complex diff.. $T$ is triangle closed path in $\Omega$, the interior point of $T$ is also contained in $\Omega$. Then $\int_T f(z)dz = 0$.

* Proof. See Textbook Page.35

Keypoint of proof: $f(z)=f(z_0)+f^\prime(z)(z-z_0)+\phi(z)(z-z_0)$, and we can show that the integral $\int_T f(z)dz = 0$, where $T$ is triangle closed path in $\Omega$.

### Theorem
$f: \Omega\to\mathbb C$ is complex diff.. There exists $F$, s.t.
$$
F(z) = \int_T f(w)dw
$$
we can claim that $F^\prime(z)=f(z)$.

* Proof. See Textbook Page.37

(Another ideal:) Consider circle path $C_1$ and $C_2\in C_1$, which $r=\epsilon$, and integral it.
